PHPMailer-ML is a Mailing List and eMessaging management tool. It is designed
to show how to use PHPMailer and process everything from one single email to a
database of subscribers. You are using this at your own risk ... you should
test this before putting in ANY environment.

REQUIREMENTS:
- PHP version 4.2.3 and up
- MySQL (three tables, they are created automatically)
- Requires your own SMTP server (GMail will also work)
  - note: we recommend using Sendmail for small to medium size mailing lists

AFTER INSTALLATION:

- One you have finished installation, the root of the path where you installed
  PHPMailer-ML is the subscription form. For example, if you installed
  PHPMailer-ML at:
  http://www.yourdomain.com/phpmailerml/
  ... that link will display the subscription form
  - to access your admin control panel, type in:
  http://www.yourdomain.com/phpmailerml/_acp-ml/

If you would like to add the subscribe form to an existing page on your site,
add the following form:

<form action="http://www.yoursite.com/yourrootpath/index.php?pg=add" method="post">
First Name: <input type="text" name="first"><BR>
Last Name: <input type="text" name="last"><BR>
Email: <input type="text" name="email"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Please provide feedback through the sourceforge.net tracker.
Please, clearly indicate your feedback is for the PHPMailer-ML package,
version 1.8.

Enjoy!
