<p><span style="color:navy;font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;">Products (Open-Source)</span><br /><br />
Over the years, there have been a number of tools that have been constant favorites in our
projects. Here&#39;s a brief description:
<ul class="noindent">
  <li><a href="http://phpmailer.worxware.com/" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">PHPMailer</span></a>.
    PHPMailer is the leading "email transport class" for PHP. PHPMailer is downloaded more than 18000 times
    each and every month by developers looking for a stable, simple email transport solution. It&#039;s always
    been small (the entire footprint is around 100 Kb), stable, and as complete a solution as you can find.
    Other tools are nowhere near as simple.<br />
    Want to help? We&#039;re looking for progressive developers to join our team of volunteer
    professionals working on PHPMailer. Our entire focus is on PHPMailer for PHP5. If you are interested,
    let us know.<br />
    <strong>We are currently looking for someone to help with new documentation. Please contact us
    if you are interested.</strong><br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://phpmailer.worxware.com/index.php?pg=phpmailerfe" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">PHPMailer-FE (Form To Email)</span></a>.
    PHPMailer-FE is the most secure and flexible Form-To-Email processor
    available. More than a simple script, PHPMailer-FE is now a complete application with plug-in
    architecture. The plug-in architecture can be used to post-process the forms data any way you
    like (such as posting directly to a database, etc.).<br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://phpmailer.worxware.com/index.php?pg=phpmailerml" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">PHPMailer-ML (Mailing List and Email Communications manager)</span></a>.
    PHPMailer-ML was originally written to showcase the use of
    PHPMailer. It can process your Email Communications from one single email address to a database
    of subscribers. Features a WYSIWYG editor for your messages, unlimited mailing lists, unlimited
    subscribers, email templates and much much more!<br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://quickskin.worxware.com/" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">QuickSkin</span></a>. QuickSkin is one of
    the truly outstanding templating engines available. It&#39;s a small footprint with big impact on your
    projects. It features a built in caching technology, token based substitution, and works on the
    concept of simple HTML files as the template. The HTML template file can contain variable information
    making it one small powerful tool for your developer tool kit.<br />
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://quickcache.worxware.com/" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">QuickCache</span></a>.
    QuickCache is an OpCode caching strategy that works on your entire site with only one line of code at the top
    of your script. The cached pages can be stored as files or as database objects. The benefits are
    absolutely astounding: bandwidth savings of up to 80% and screen display times increased by 8 - 10x.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p>We&#39;re committed to PHP and to the Open Source community.</p>

Proprietary licensed, free for non-commercial use (licenses available for commercial use):
<ul class="noindent">
  <li><a href="http://quickcsv.worxware.com/" target="_blank"><span class="hightext">QuickCSV Suite</span></a>.
    QuickCSV Suite is an bundled application that can easily upload your CSV files directly to MySQL and download
    MySQL tables to CSV. Handles Microsoft Excel created CSV files (with inconsistent field-by-field enclosures).
    Visual field mapping, store field maps for later reuse. Fast and handles large CSV files.<br />
